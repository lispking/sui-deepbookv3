### The Story Behind Open-Sourcing Code: The Birth and Choice of the Rust Version of the DeepSeek v3 Library
Four months ago, I finished developing the Rust version of the DeepSeek v3 library. Full of anticipation, I applied to the official organization for a grant. However, all I received was a brief reply: "Sorry, we can't approve this grant application." After a momentary feeling of disappointment, I decided to open-source the code, hoping that this achievement could be used by the community and that the value of this technological breakthrough could shine in a broader arena.
